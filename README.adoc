= Terminus

This is a {ruby_link}/{hanami_link} project that allows you to point a {trmnl_link} device to your own server which can be running on your local network or in the cloud. This is also the flagship implementation officially supported by {trmnl_link}.

toc::[]

== Features

* Allows you to run your own server.
* Built atop {ruby_link} and {hanami_link}.
* Provides automatic detection of your server's IP address.
* Uses {htmx_link}.
* Uses {imagemagick_link}.
* Uses {overmind_link}.
* Uses {postgres_link}.
* Uses {puma_link}.

The goal isn't for BYOS to match parity with our hosted solution but to provide enough of a pleasant solution for your own customized experience. There are trade offs either way but we've got you covered for whatever path you wish to travel. üéâ

== Requirements

. {ruby_link}.
. {postgres_link}.
. {hanami_link}.
. {docker_link} (optional).
. A {trmnl_link} device.

== Setup

To set up project, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami terminus
cd terminus
bin/setup
----

== Usage

To launch the server, run:

[source,bash]
----
# Development
overmind start --port-step 10 --procfile Procfile.dev --can-die assets,migrate

# Production
overmind start --port-step 10 --can-die assets,migrate
----

To view the app, use either of the following:

* *Secure*: https://localhost:2443
* *Insecure*: http://localhost:2300

=== Configuration

There are a few environment variables you can use to customize behavior:

* `API_URI`: Needed for connecting your device to this server. Defaults to your wired IP address.
* `DATABASE_URL`: Necessary to connect to your {postgres_link} database. Can be customized by changing the value in the `.env.development` or `.env.test` file created when you ran `bin/setup`.
* `FIRMWARE_ROOT`: The root location for firmware updates. Defaults to `public/assets/firmware`.
* `PREVIEWS_ROOT`: The root location for all device screen preview images when designing new screens. Defaults to `public/assets/previews`
* `SCREENS_ROOT`: The root location for all device screens (images). Defaults to `public/assets/screens`.

=== Device Provisioning

There are a couple of ways you can provision a device with this server.

The first is automatic which happens immediately after you have successfully used the WiFi captive portal on your mobile phone to connect your TRMNL device to your local network where this server is running. You can also delete your device, via the UI, and it'll be reconfigured for you automatically when the device next makes a xref:_display[Display API] request.


The second way is to manually add your device via the UI. At a minimum, you only need to know your device's MAC Address when entering your device information within the UI.

That's it!

=== Background Pollers

There are two background pollers that cache data from the remote link:https://usetrmnl.com[Core] server for improved performance:

* *Firmware* (`bin/pollers/firmware`): Downloads the latest firmware for updating your local devices. By default, this checks for updates every six hours.
* *Screen* (`bin/pollers/screen`): Downloads device screens for any device you have set up to proxy to the Core server. You only need to toggle _proxy_ support for any/all devices you want to pull from Core. This allows you to leverage any/all recipes/plugins you have configured via your remote account. By default, this checks for updates every five minutes.

Both of these processes can be configured to use different polling intervals by passing in a different value in seconds. You can do this by modifying each script. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
# bin/pollers/firmware
poller.call seconds: 60

# bin/pollers/screen
poller.call seconds: 30
----

Each automatically run in the background as separate processes in both the `Procfile` and `Procfile.dev` files. The latter is built for you when running `bin/setup`.

When using {overmind_link}, you can restart these pollers (as with any process managed by Overmind) as follows:

[source,bash]
----
overmind restart firmware_poller
overmind restart screen_poller
----

This can be handy if you want to force either of these poller's to check for new content.

=== APIs

This section documents all supported API endpoints. Each endpoint uses HTTPS which requires accepting your locally generated SSL certificate. If you don't want this behavior, you can switch to using HTTP (see above).

Some endpoints use either the HTTP `ID`, `Access-Token` or both headers. These break down as follows:

* `ID`: Your device's MAC address.
* `Access-Token`: Your device's API key.

See each endpoint for further details.

==== Display

Used for displaying new content to your device. Your device's refresh rate determines how often this occurs.

.Request
[%collapsible]
====
*Without Base64 Encryption*

[source,bash]
----
curl "https://localhost:2443/api/display/" \
     -H 'ID: <redacted>' \
     -H 'Access-Token: <redacted>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
----

*With Base64 Encryption via HTTP Header*

[source,bash]
----
curl "https://localhost:2443/api/display/" \
     -H 'ID: <redacted>' \
     -H 'Access-Token: <redacted>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'BASE64: true'
----

*With Base64 Encryption via Parameter*

[source,bash]
----
curl "https://localhost:2443/api/display/?base_64=true" \
     -H 'ID: <redacted>' \
     -H 'Access-Token: <redacted>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
----

Both the `ID` and `Access-Token` HTTP headers are required for all of these API calls but these _optional_ headers can be supplied as well which mimics what each device includes each request:

* `BATTERY_VOLTAGE`: Must a a float (usually 0.0 to 4.1).
* `FW_VERSION`: The firmware version (i.e. `1.2.3`).
* `HOST`: The host (usually the IP address).
* `REFRESH_RATE`: The refresh rate as saved on the device. Example: 100.
* `RSSI`: The signal strength (usually -100 to 100).
* `USER_AGENT`: The device name.
* `WIDTH`: The device width. Example: 800.
* `HEIGHT`: :The device height. Example: 480.

==== Screens

Used for generating new device screens by supplying HTML content for rendering, screenshotting, and grey scaling to render properly on your device.

This endpoint supports full HTML so you can supply CSS styles, full DOM, etc. At a minimum, you'll want to use the following to prevent white borders showing up around your generated screens:

[source,css]
----
* {
  margin: 0;
}
----

üéóÔ∏è You can use the UI Editor to build custom screens in real-time for faster feedback. The result of your work can be supplied to this endpoint to create a new screen for display on your device.

.Request

====
[source,bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "https://localhost:2443/api/screens" \

    -d $'{
 "image": {
   "content": "<p>Test</p>",
   "file_name": "test"
 }
}'
----

The `Access-Token` is your device's MAC address. You can obtain this information from the UI.

If you don't supply a `file_name`, the server will generate one for you using a UUID for the file name. You can find all generated images in `public/assets/screens`.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/usetrmnl/terminus
cd terminus
bin/setup
----

=== Console

To access the console with direct access to all objects, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

Once in the console, you can do the following:

[source,ruby]
----
# Use a repository.
repository = Hanami.app["repositories.device"]

repository.all              # View all devices.
device = repository.find 1  # Find by Device ID.

# Fetch next device screen. Sorts in descending order by modified timestamp.
fetcher = Hanami.app["aspects.screens.fetcher"]
fetcher.call device.slug

# Generate device screen with random name.
# üí° "A1B2C3D4E5F6" would be your device slug (i.e. collapsed MAC Address).
creator = Terminus::Screens::Creator.new
creator.call "<p>Test</p>",
             Pathname(Hanami.app[:settings].screens_root).join("A1B2C3D4E5F6/%<name>s.bmp")
#<Pathname:terminus/public/assets/screens/A1B2C3D4E5F6/5af3f06-775f-4ae9-8bb1-246d9a5200c9.bmp>

# To generate image with specific name.
creator.call "<p>Test.</p>", Pathname(Hanami.app[:settings].screens_root).join("demo.bmp")
#<Pathname:terminus/public/assets/screens/demo.bmp>
----

When creating images, you might find this HTML template valuable as a starting point as this let's you use the full capabilities of HTML to create new images for your device.

.HTML Template
[%collapsible]
====
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no">

    <title>Demo</title>

    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <style type="text/css">
      * {
        margin: 0;
      }
    </style>

    <script type="text/javascript">
    </script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <img src="uri/to/image" alt="Image"/>
  </body>
</html>
----
====

Use of `margin` zero is important to prevent default browser styles from creating borders around your image which will show up when rendered on your device. Otherwise, you have full capabilities to render any kind of page you want using whatever HTML you like. Anything is possible because `Terminus::Screens::Creator` is designed to screenshot your rendered HTML as a 800x480 image to render on your device. If you put all this together, that means you can do this in the console:

.Image Generation
[%collapsible]
====
[source,ruby]
----
creator = Terminus::Screens::Creator.new

creator.call(<<~CONTENT, Pathname(Hanami.app[:settings].screens_root).join("A1B2C3D4E5F6/%<name>s.bmp"))
  <!DOCTYPE html>

  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no">

      <title>Demo</title>

      <meta charset="utf-8">

      <style type="text/css">
        * {
          margin: 0;
        }
      </style>

      <script type="text/javascript">
      </script>
    </head>

    <body>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </body>
  </html>
CONTENT
----
====

The above will create a new image in the `public/screens` folder of this application which will eventually render on your device. üéâ

=== YJIT

{yjit_link} is enabled by default if detected which means you have built and installed Ruby with YJIT enabled. If you didn't build Ruby with YJIT support, YJIT support will be ignored. That said, we _recommend_ you enable YJIT support since the performance improvements are worth it.

üí° To enable YJIT globally, ensure the `--yjit` flag is added to your `RUBYOPT` environment variable. Example: `export RUBYOPT="--yjit"`.

=== CSS

Pure CSS is used in order to avoid pulling in complicated frameworks. The following stylesheets allow you to customize the look and feel of this application as follows:

* *Settings*: Use to customize site settings.
* *Colors*: Use to customize site colors.
* *Keyframes*: Use to customize keyframe behavior.
* *View Transitions*: Use to customize view transitions.
* *Defaults*: Use to customize HTML element defaults.
* *Layout*: Use to customize the site layout.
* *Components*: Use to customize general site components.
* *Dashboard*: Use to customize the dashboard page.
* *Devices*: Use to customize the devices page.
* *Designer*: Use to customize the designer page.

For responsive resolutions, the following measurements are used:

* *Extra Small*: 300px
* *Small*: 500px
* *Medium*: 825px
* *Large*: 1000px
* *Extra Large*: 1500px

=== HTML/CSS Sanitization

The link:https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize[Santize] gem is used to sanitize HTML/CSS when using the console, API, or UI. All of this configured via the `Terminus::Sanitizer` class which defaults to the `Sanitize::Config::RELAXED` style with additional support for `style` and `source` elements. If you find elements being stripped from your HTML/CSS content, this is why. Feel free to open an link:https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami/issues[issue] if you need additional support.

=== Logging

By default, all logging is set to `INFO` level but you can get more verbose information by using the `DEBUG` level. There are multiple ways to do this. First, you can export the desired debug level:

[source,bash]
----
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
----

You can also specify the log level before launching the server:

[source,bash]
----
LOG_LEVEL=debug overmind start --port-step 10 --procfile Procfile.dev --can-die assets,migrate
----

Finally, you can configure the app to use a different log level via `lib/terminus/lib_container.rb` by adjusting log level of logger during registration:

[source,ruby]
----
register(:logger) { Cogger.new id: :terminus, level: :debug, formatter: :detail }

----

üí° See the {cogger_link} gem documentation for further details.

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/rake
----

== Docker

{docker_link} is supported both for production and development purposes. Each is explained below.

=== Compose

link:https://docs.docker.com/compose[Docker Compose] support is provided so you can quickly spin up the images and containers for running this application either in development or production. Full details are captured in the `compose.yml` at the root of this project. The `compose.yml` can also be configured via the following environment variables:

* `PG_USER`: Your PostgreSQL user name.
* `PG_DATABASE`: Your PostgreSQL database name.
* `PG_PASSWORD`: Your PostgreSQL password.

üí° The above is automatically generated for you when running `bin/setup` with safe default values but customization is definitely encouraged.

=== Development

To develop with Docker, you can use the same tooling as explained below in the _Production_ section below by using Docker Compose to manage all services while running and using each locally.

=== Production

To build an image for production purpose, use the `Dockerfile` and `bin/docker` scripts. Here's how each works:

* `bin/docker/build`: This will build a production Docker image based on latest changes to this project.
* `bin/docker/console`: This will immediately give you a console for which to explore you Docker image from the command line.
* `bin/docker/entrypoint`: This is used by the `Dockerfile` when building your Docker image.

There is also a `compose.yml` in the root of this project that configures both the web (Hanami) and database (PostgreSQL) services for quickly launching the entire stack. Run `docker-compose up` from the root of this project to launch the entire stack.

== Tools

The following is additional tooling, developed by the Open Source community, that might be of interest for use with this application:

* link:https://github.com/clarson15/terminus-publisher[Terminus Publisher]: Provides a way to generate and publish content to Terminus for display on your device.

== Credits

* Built with link:https://alchemists.io/projects/hanamismith[Hanamismith].
* Engineered by {trmnl_link}.
