== Requirements

* {git_link}.
* {ruby_link}.
* {hanami_link}.
* {node_link}.
* {postgres_link}.
* {valkey_link}: Can be swapped out for {redis_link} or {dragonfly_link} if desired.
* {hadolint_link} (optional, for development): For `Dockerfile` linting.
* {chrome_link} (optional, for development): For screen generation via the headless browser.
* {overmind_link} (optional, for development): Uses your `Procfile` to launch processes.

== Quick Start

To immediately spin up Terminus on your local machine using {docker_link}, run:

[source,bash]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami/refs/heads/main/scripts/docker/quick.sh | bash
----

Once launched, open `http://localhost:2300` in your browser then click the _Register_ link to register and log into the system.

⚠️ This script is not idempotent which means you can't run it more than once since your database credentials will be different each time. This is only meant for getting up and running quickly to explore the feature set, not permanent use. For permanent use, see the link:doc/docker.adoc[Docker] documentation.

== Setup

To set up this project for local development, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami terminus
cd terminus
bin/setup
----

💡 The setup script is idempotent so you can run it multiple times without harm. To rebuild a file managed by the setup script, delete the desired file and rerun setup to recreate.

== Upgrade

To upgrade this project for local development, run:

[source,bash]
----
cd terminus
bin/upgrade
----

Watch for any changes that need to be addressed in the output. Otherwise, if no changes are detected, you are set.

== Usage

To launch the server, run:

[source,bash]
----
# Development
overmind start --port-step 10 --procfile Procfile.dev --can-die assets,migrate

# Production
overmind start --port-step 10 --can-die assets,migrate
----

To view the app, use either of the following:

* *Secure*: https://localhost:2443
* *Insecure*: http://localhost:2300

From your browser, you can then click on the _Register_ link to register and log into the system.

=== Configuration

There are several environment variables you can use to customize behavior by updating the `.env` file created for you during setup. They are:

* `API_ACCESS_TOKEN_PERIOD`: Used to set the amount of time, in seconds, the JWT access token remains valid before needing to refresh your token. This is only necessary when using the link:doc/api.adoc[Server APIs]. Default: 1,800 seconds (30 minutes).
* `APP_SECRET`: Used for session, cookie, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. This is automatically created for you during setup but is recommended that you update this with your own secure value.
* `APP_SETUP`: Runs setup/update steps (i.e. asset compilation, database migrations, etc). Used by Docker only via the `entrypoint` script. Default: `nil` but `true` for the web service.
* `API_URI`: Used for connecting your device to this server or via link:doc/docker.adoc[Docker]. Defaults to your host machine's IP address and port. This assumes you are connecting your device directly to the same server Terminus is running on. If this is not the case and you are using a reverse proxy, DNS, or any service/layer between your device and Terminus then you need to update this value to be your host. For example, if your host is `http://demo.io` then this value must be `http://demo.io`. This includes updating your device, via the TRMNL captive Wifi portal, to use `http://demo.io` as your custom host too. How you configure `http://demo.io` to resolve to the server you are running Terminus on is up to you. All your device (and this value) cares about is what the external host (or IP and port) is for the device to make API requests too (they must be identical).
* `BROWSER`: Used for configuring headless browser behavior when creating screens for your device. Must be a JSON object. Default: `'{"js_errors": true, "process_timeout": 10, "timeout": 10}'`. Additional keys are ignored. For more details, see the link:https://github.com/rubycdp/ferrum#customization[Ferrum Customization Documentation].
* `CERTIFICATE_URLS`: Defines a comma-separated list of CA certificate URLs which will be automatically installed as trusted certificates. Example: `"https://example.io/ca1.crt,https://example.org/ca2.pem"` Used by {docker_doc_link} only.
* `DATABASE_NAME`: Defines your database name. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `terminus`.
* `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Defines your database password. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: (auto-generated for you during setup).
* `DATABASE_PORT`: Defines your database port. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `5432`.
* `DATABASE_URL`: Defines the full URL based on the `+DATABASE_*+` settings. This is automatically configured for you during setup. See your `+.env*+` files for details.
* `DATABASE_URL`: Necessary to connect to your {postgres_link} database. Can be customized by changing the value in the `.env.development` or `.env.test` file created when you ran `bin/setup`.
* `DATABASE_USER`: Defines your database user. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `terminus`.
* `FIRMWARE_POLLER`: Enables/disables firmware polling. See {jobs_link} for details. Defaults to enabled.
* `HANAMI_PORT`: The default port when running the app locally or via {docker_doc_link}. When using Docker, this is used for the internal and external port mapping.
* `KEYVALUE_DATABASE`: Defines your database ID. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `0`.
* `KEYVALUE_PASSWORD`: Defines your password. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: (auto-generated for you during setup).
* `KEYVALUE_PORT`: Defines your port. Used by {docker_doc_link} only. Default: `6379`.
* `KEYVALUE_URL`: Defines the full URL based on the above `+KEYVALUE_*+` settings. This is automatically configured for you during setup. See your `+.env*+` files for details.
* `MODEL_POLLER`: Enables/disables model polling. See {jobs_link} for details. Defaults to enabled.
* `RACK_ATTACK_ALLOWED_SUBNETS`: Defines the {rack_attack_link} subnets that are allowed to connect to this server which helps when adding DNS, a reverse proxy, or a VPN, etc. between your device and this application so you can use this environment variable to add more subnets as desired. This takes a single subnet/IP or an array -- with no spaces -- of subnets/IPs as values. Example: "111.111.111.111,150.120.0.0/16". Alternatively, you can disable Rack Attack altogether by removing the `config.middleware.use Rack::Attack` line from `config/app.rb` or customize Rack Attack via the `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb` file. Any of these approaches will allow you to get your service layer properly configured so your device can talk to this server. By default, the following subnets are allowed: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1`.
* `SCREEN_POLLER`: Enables/disables model polling. See {jobs_link} for details. Defaults to enabled.

=== Users

When launching this application for the first time, there will be no users. The first user to register will automatically be given _Verified_ status along with full access to the system. All subsequent users will marked as _Unverified_ and must be manually _Verified_ in order to have access to the system. In the future, more fine grained control will be provided for individual users, roles, and permissions.

Also, once logged in, you can manage your settings as follows:

* Visit `/me/login` to update your email address.
* Visit `/me/password` to update your password.
* Visit `/me/remember` to enable, disable, or forget if you should be remembered.

=== Devices

Connecting devices requires using the WiFi captive portal on your mobile phone to connect your TRMNL device to your local network where this server is running. You can also delete your device, via the UI and/or API, and it'll be reconfigured for you automatically when the device next makes a link:doc/api.adoc#display[Display API] request. For more information (including dealing with tricky WiFi situations), check out the help guides:

=== Firmware

In accordance with the {unbrickable_pledge_link}, the latest version of Terminus always supports the latest version of our {firmware_link}. If you are running on older firmware, you'll need to use an older version of Terminus. Here's a rough breakdown of the Firmware version history where changes were applied that might cause issues if you haven't upgraded your devices in a while:

* *Firmware 1.6.9* (and lower): Supported by Terminus link:https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami/releases/tag/0.41.0[0.41.0] and lower.
* *Firmware 1.6.10* (and higher): Supported by Terminus link:https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_hanami/releases/tag/0.42.0[0.42.0] and higher.
